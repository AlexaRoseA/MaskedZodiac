## Powers of each mask (not implemented fully)
#### Cat Mask
The Cat mask is what your tribe gave you. **Press shift to sneak**, your movements will be slower, but no one can see you! This is what you will use to take a mask from the tribes you need to infiltrate. 

#### Ox Mask (December 22 to January 20)
The Ox mask is very useful when you are in a pinch, but it can be felt miles away. While using the mask, you will gain a strength boost, which will boost other skills such as speed and keenness, but other creatures/masks will be hesitant/scared of you. 

#### Tiger Mask (January 21 to February 19)
The Tiger Mask helps you climb up walls that seemed impossible to do before. With the tiger mask, you can cling onto walls and look ahead on the horizon.

#### Rabbit Mask (February 20 to March 20)
The Rabbit masks gives you an extra leap. Double jump in the air with a boost from the mask!

#### Dragon Mask (March 21 to April 19)
The Dragon mask allows you to break your wings and soar. Gain shadow wings to give you a boost up, and **soar through the air after your jumps by holding space**.

#### Snake Mask (April 20 to May 20)
The Snake mask allows you to crouch move with a small element of surprise. The first half of the crouch will be hidden on a faster timer than the cat mask, but the crouch allows you to go in places normally too slow for you to reach.

#### Horse Mask (May 21 to June 21)
The Horse mask gains you a boost of speed and grace! With the horse mask, your speed is faster as well as your luck is increased in the general market.

#### Sheep Mask (June 22 to July 21)
The Sheep mask allows you to nap and get a health boost... but be careful, enemies are now more attracted to you, especialy while in sleep mode.

#### Monkey Mask (July 22 to August 21)
The Monkey Mask allows you to climb up walls and trees! 

#### Rooster Mask (August 22 to September 22)
The Rooster Mask allows you to alert *all* enemies by cawking your loud voice!

#### Dog Mask (September 23 to October 22)
The Dog Mask allows you to alert your enemies in front of you and spook them! Using this, they might drop items that you can take from them, removing boosts they had before.

#### Pig Mask (October 23 to November 21)
The Pig Mask allows you to smell items/food/ect anywhere on the map, but your vision in dark areas is limited.

#### Rat Mask (November 22 to December 21)
The Rat Mask allows you to shrink in size, finding the hidden areas around the market and map to gain rewards and treasures.
